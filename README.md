# par README file
Feb 15, 2025. Copied the template for this website from this [site](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp). After playing around a lot with github parameters I found that it's best not to mess with them. Also, installing Jekyll as described in the help pages, but it's just not working. I works locally, but once it's pushed up to github Jeckyll does not find the .css file. Spent a lot of time looking at this and giving up.
