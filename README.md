# par README file  
- Dec 16, 2025. Boheme copies a file called latest_backups.html to this directory so it can be displayed on the home.html page
- Aug 30, 2025. To update the terms update the file Terms.odp in Google Drive --> Website_and_wiki_files
- Mar 12, 2025. Tried make an iframe for the backup website, but firefox gives me a warning that it's a security risk to display it
- Feb 15, 2025. Copied the template for this website from this [site](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp). After playing around a lot with github parameters I found that it's best not to mess with them. Also, installing Jekyll as described in the help pages, but it's just not working. I works locally, but once it's pushed up to github Jeckyll does not find the .css file. Spent a lot of time looking at this and giving up.
